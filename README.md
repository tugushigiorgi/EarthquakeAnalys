# Significant Earthquakes, 1965-2016 Analysis With Python

**Csv file used:** [ Earthquake Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usgs/earthquake-database)

This project contains analysis and charts about earthquakes that occurred between 1965-2016 for different reasons such as nuclear explosions, rock bursts, and more.

## Includes Charts:
- Scatter chart: Magnitude vs Seismic Stations vs Horizontal Distance
- Bar chart: Average magnitude by type (e.g., earthquake, nuclear, rock burst, etc.)
- Histogram: Depth Error Distribution
- Depth Over Period

Also, I have used `melt` and `pivot_table` to summarize the data based on specific columns.
